# Recursion

This is a collection of programs using recursion. This repository contains three programs:

* Knight's tour: finds a solution to the knight's tour problem, if it exists. A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a checkerboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. The program works on a 5x5 checkerboard and the user can choose the starting box.
* Maze solver: finds a path to the exit of a 5x5 maze from a starting point chosen by the user. It employs a DFS algorithm that guarantees to find a solution, if it exists, but it may not be the shortest one.
* Permutations: shows all the numbers that can be obtained changing the order of the digits of a natural number given by the user.
